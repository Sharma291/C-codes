# C-codes
Some standard C language codes.
Hello guys , I'm a beginner and started to code recently.
I have coded some of the very basic questions on C language.
You can find them in the files.
These are directly uploaded so there are no specific names mentioned on files , you will have to navigate through them.
Sorry for the inconvinience.
Feel free to share me some tips and tricks about how I should proceed further.
